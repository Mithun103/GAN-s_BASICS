# Creating Realistic Images with GANs 🧠🖼️

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to generate realistic images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It is designed as an educational and practical guide for anyone interested in deep learning and image generation.

## 📌 Project Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks where two neural networks — a **Generator** and a **Discriminator** — contest with each other. The generator tries to produce data that looks real, while the discriminator evaluates its authenticity.

This notebook walks you through:
- Basic GAN architecture
- Data preprocessing
- Training a simple GAN model
- Visualizing generated images
- Observing convergence over epochs

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🖼️ Output Samples

During training, the notebook visualizes the generated images at intervals to show the progression of learning.
